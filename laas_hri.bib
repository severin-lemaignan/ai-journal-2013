  Abstract                 = {Ambient environments which integrate a number of sensing devices and actuators intended for use by human users need to be able to express knowledge about objects, their functions and their properties to assist in the performance of everyday tasks. For this to occur perceptual data must be grounded to symbolic information that in its turn can be used in the communication with the human. For symbolic information to be meaningful it should be part of a rich knowledge base that includes an ontology of concepts and common sense. In this work we present an integration between ResearchCyc and an anchoring framework that mediates the connection between the perceptual information in an intelligent home environment and the reasoning system. Through simple dialogues we validate how objects placed in the home environment are grounded by a network of sensors and made available to a larger KB where reasoning is exploited. This first integration work is a step towards integrating the richness of a KRR system developed over many years in isolation, with a physically embedded intelligent system.},

I'd be curious to know what kind of reasoning capability they actually have. * Their tests are conducted in a static environment. They don't take other agents into consideration (nothing like perspective taking or rich disambiguation). * No task planning at all (or at least, not discussed in this paper) More in details: - object identification based on viewpoint independent SIFT features - formalized anchoring system that explicitely match percieved attributes to predicates - Cyc predicates - ground 12 colors, based on a paper on color perception. Could be useful for us. - idem, they cite a paper on what spatial relations to compute - location of objects based on a previously provided semantic map (but not much on this semantic map) - two "memories": the robot memory stores the current list of percieved objects ; the archive memory stores what is not percieved anymore - uses directly Cyc (ie, 250 000 common sense concepts...), via CycL language -> 2nd and higher order logics (quantification over predicates, functions, etc) Remark: using 2nd order logic (ie meta statements), it would be easy to store the knowledge of each agent - disambiguation in concept name by asking human to decide amongst all concepts known by Cyc - template based natural language - experiment conducted in a "smart" indoor environmement + simple robot},

In particular, we are developing an extension to the traditional three-layered robot architecture that enables robots to interact directly at each layer -- at the behavioral level, the robots create distributed control loops; at the executive level, they synchronize task execution; at the planning level, they use market-based techniques to assign tasks, form teams, and allocate resources. We illustrate these ideas in the context of a Mars exploration scenario.},

  Notes                    = {- The "Ann and Sally" experiment. A child watches this scene: Ann watches Sally to put an object in a basket. Sally leaves and Ann moves the object from the basket to the table. The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she will return? The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children) doesn't answer "on the table" The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up! - The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names 3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content of the attitude. The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4) to be a telephone. I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana" scene. In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must be able to attribute a false belief to the agent. Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent. The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile household robots need much knowledge about objects, places and actions when performing more and more complex tasks. They must be able to recognize objects, know what they are and how they can be used. We present a practical approach to robot knowledge representation that combines description logics knowledge bases with a rich environment model, data mining and (self-) observation modules. The robot observes itself and humans while executing actions and uses the collected experiences to learn models of action-related concepts grounded in its perception and action system. We demonstrate our approach by learning places that are involved in mobile robot manipulation actions, by locating objects based on their function and by supplying knowledge required for understanding underspecified task descriptions as commonly given by humans.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an overview of a newly developed Coupled Layer Architecture for Robotic Autonomy (CLARAty), which is designed for improving the modularity of system software while more tightly coupling the interaction of autonomy and controls. First, we frame the problem by briefly reviewing previous work in the field and describing the impediments and constraints that been encountered. Then we describe why a fresh approach to the topic is warranted, and introduce our new two-tiered design as an evolutionary modification of the conventional three-level robotics architecture. The new design features a tight coupling of the planner and executive in one Decision Layer, which interacts with a separate Functional Layer at all levels of system granularity. The Functional Layer is an object-oriented software hierarchy that provides basic capabilities of system operation, resource prediction, state estimation, and status reporting. The Decision Layer utilizes these capabilities of the Functional Layer to achieve goals by expanding, ordering, initiating and terminating activities. Both declarative and procedural planning methods are used in this process. Current efforts are targeted at implementing an initial version of this architecture on our research Mars rover platforms, Rocky 7 and 8. In addition, we are working with the NASA robotics and autonomy communities to expand the scope and participation in this architecture, moving toward a flight implementation in the 2007 time-frame},
